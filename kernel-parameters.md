# Kernel Parameters Reference

> Centralized list of recommended kernel command line parameters for Zettlab D6/D8 Ultra running Ubuntu 26.04.

This page collects all kernel parameters used across the guides to avoid duplication and make maintenance easier.

## Recommended Combined Parameters

Edit `/etc/default/grub`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Set `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` to:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash modprobe.blacklist=r8169 video=eDP-1:d snd_intel_dspcfg.dsp_driver=1"
```

Then apply:

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

> **Note**: The `crashkernel=` parameter is automatically added by Ubuntu when kdump is enabled. You can safely leave it as-is.

## Parameter Breakdown

| Parameter                              | Purpose                                      | Required?     | Related Guide                  |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `modprobe.blacklist=r8169`             | Prevent in-tree Realtek driver from loading  | Recommended   | [Networking](networking-r8127.md) |
| `video=eDP-1:d`                        | Disable front LCD during boot (prevents hang)| Yes           | [Installation](ubuntu-installation.md) |
| `snd_intel_dspcfg.dsp_driver=1`        | Force legacy HDA audio driver (fix Dummy Output) | Yes        | [Audio](audio-HDA-driver.md)   |

## `video=eDP-1:d` Is a Trade-off, Not a Fix

This parameter **disables the front panel at kernel level**. Nothing can then draw on
it — not a framebuffer program, not Weston, nothing.

| Goal | Setting |
|---|---|
| HDMI console readable, front panel unused | keep `video=eDP-1:d` |
| Use the front panel (stats, status, artwork) | **remove** `video=eDP-1:d` |

Keep it for the installation itself — the installer runs on the console, which is
exactly what the conflict breaks. Remove it afterwards if you want the panel.

On a headless NAS removing it costs nothing: the squashed HDMI console only matters
when a monitor is attached. See [front-lcd-control.md](front-lcd-control.md) for why
the conflict exists and what to do with the panel once it is alive.

## Current Status Notes

- The onboard Realtek RTL8127 NIC has been abandoned due to instability. A USB-C Ethernet adapter is used instead.
- Only the in-tree driver (`r8169`) is blacklisted. The out-of-tree `r8127` driver is not installed.
- `pcie_aspm=off` and `pcie_port_pm=off` have been removed (no longer needed after abandoning the onboard NIC).
- The front LCD (`eDP-1`) is disabled via `video=eDP-1:d` because enabling it forces HDMI to match its 640x172 resolution. This issue is unresolved — see [Installation Guide](ubuntu-installation.md).

## How to View Current Parameters

```bash
cat /proc/cmdline
```

## Future Additions

When adding new kernel parameters in other guides, please also update this file so everything stays in sync.
