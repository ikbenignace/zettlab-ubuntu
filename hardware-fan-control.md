# Fan Control Configuration

> Implements dynamic, temperature-adaptive fan control for both CPU and disk fans on Zettlab D6/D8 Ultra using the `zettlab_d8_fans` kernel module.

## Overview

This guide supports both D6 (6-bay) and D8 (8-bay) variants. The control logic maintains:

- **CPU Package Temperature**: Idle 42–52 °C, Sustained load ≤68 °C
- **HDD Temperatures**: Idle 35–40 °C, Sustained load ≤45 °C

The fan curves are designed to be:

- Highly responsive when temperatures are rising (fast fan ramp-up)
- Much less responsive when temperatures are falling (fans stay higher longer)
- Protected against excessive PWM changes using **timer-based hysteresis**

Both CPU and HDD controllers follow consistent design principles:

- EMA smoothing is calculated before the emergency full-speed check
- Emergency override uses the smoothed temperature (protected against single raw sensor spikes)
- Identical anti-chatter timer logic and asymmetric rise/fall response
- On any temperature sensor read failure, the system forces full fan speed (183 PWM) for safety

## Verified sysfs Interface

Confirmed on Ubuntu 26.04, kernel 7.0.0-30-generic:

```
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonN/     name = zettlab_d8_fans
  pwm1  pwm2  pwm3           0-183   (not 0-255)
  pwm1_enable ...            present, but read-only on this build
  fan1_input  fan2_input  fan3_input    tachometer, RPM
  fan1_label  fan2_label  fan3_label    "Disks 1" / "Disks 2" / "CPU"
```

`fanN_label` confirms the mapping on a live system, so you do not have to trust the
table below — read it off the hardware.

Writing `pwmN_enable` returns `Permission denied`. That is harmless: writing `pwmN`
directly works without it.

Typical readings at idle with the curve services running: disk fans ~920 rpm at PWM 67,
CPU fan ~3550 rpm at PWM 120.

> **DKMS signs the module automatically.** On Ubuntu the build is signed with
> `/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv` as part of `dkms build`. With Secure Boot off it
> loads regardless; with Secure Boot on you still need to enrol that MOK.

## Fan Mapping

| Fan   | Target Component     |
|-------|----------------------|
| fan1  | Rear disk fan 1      |
| fan2  | Rear disk fan 2      |
| fan3  | CPU fan              |

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 26.04 Server installed
- User account with `sudo` privileges
- Zettlab D6/D8 Ultra hardware
- `linux-headers-generic` package installed (recommended for reliable DKMS behavior after kernel updates)

## Kernel Module Installation

### Step 1: Install via DKMS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haveacry/zettlab-d8-fans.git
cd zettlab-d8-fans

sudo mkdir -p /usr/src/zettlab-d8-fans-0.0.1
sudo cp -r * /usr/src/zettlab-d8-fans-0.0.1/

sudo dkms add -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo dkms build -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo modprobe zettlab_d8_fans
```

### Step 2: Enable Automatic Loading

```bash
echo zettlab_d8_fans | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/zettlab_d8_fans.conf
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
lsmod | grep zettlab_d8_fans

for d in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do
    [ -f "$d/name" ] && echo "$d: $(cat "$d/name")"
done

sensors
```

## The First Kernel Upgrade Will Catch You Out

Observed on a real install, and worth understanding before it bites.

`linux-headers-generic` is a **meta-package that pulls the newest kernel**, which is
often newer than the one you are running. So this sequence quietly leaves you exposed:

```
19:58:46  apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-generic ...
          -> also installs linux-image-7.0.0-31-generic  (you are running -30)
19:59:37  dkms add / build / install
          -> builds for the RUNNING kernel only, -30
```

DKMS' autoinstall hook fires **when a kernel is installed**. At 19:58 the module did not
exist yet, so nothing was built for `-31`. `dkms status` then shows only `-30`, which
looks perfectly healthy — until you reboot into `-31` and the module is simply absent:

```
ERROR: Could not find hwmon device with name 'zettlab_d8_fans'.
hdd-fan-curve.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
```

**Both fan services fail and the fans revert to whatever the firmware last set.**

### Cover every installed kernel after adding the module

```bash
sudo dkms autoinstall
sudo dkms status            # expect a line per installed kernel, not just one
```

Or target one explicitly:

```bash
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1 -k 7.0.0-31-generic
```

Once the module is registered for every installed kernel, later upgrades do rebuild it
automatically — the hook works, it just had nothing to act on the first time.

### Verify before you trust it

`dkms status` showing one kernel is the tell. Compare it against what is installed:

```bash
ls /lib/modules | sort
dkms status
```

Any kernel in the first list that is missing from the second will boot without your
module.

## After Kernel Updates

When Ubuntu installs a new kernel, DKMS should automatically rebuild the `zettlab_d8-fans` module for the new kernel. If it doesn't (you may see `Exec format error` or fan services failing), rebuild manually:

### Recommended One-Time Setup

Ensure the generic kernel headers package is installed so DKMS can always build:

```bash
sudo apt install linux-headers-generic
```

### Manual Rebuild (if DKMS didn't auto-rebuild)

Reboot into the new kernel first, then:

```bash
sudo dkms remove -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1 --all
sudo dkms build -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo modprobe zettlab_d8_fans
sudo systemctl restart cpu-fan-curve.service hdd-fan-curve.service
```

Verify the module is loaded:

```bash
lsmod | grep zettlab_d8_fans
for d in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do
    [ -f "$d/name" ] && echo "$d: $(cat "$d/name")"
done
```

### Why This Happens

The `Exec format error` occurs when the compiled kernel module was built against a different kernel version than the one currently running. DKMS has a quirk: when building for a non-running kernel, it may use the wrong headers (the running kernel's instead of the target's), producing a module with wrong vermagic. Always rebuild after rebooting into the new kernel.

### If You Must Fix Before Rebooting

If `apt upgrade` leaves packages broken and you can't reboot yet, the old kernel headers may be incomplete (missing `autoconf.h`). Fix with:

```bash
sudo apt install -y flex bison libelf-dev
cd /usr/src/linux-headers-<old-version>  # e.g., 7.0.0-22-generic
sudo make syncconfig
cd ~
sudo dkms build -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

This generates the missing files in the old headers so DKMS can build. After this, reboot into the new kernel and rebuild again to ensure the module is built against the correct kernel.

## CPU Fan Control

### Script Location

`/usr/local/sbin/cpu-fan-curve.sh`

### Key Parameters

| Parameter                | Default | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `TARGET_CPU_C`           | 54      | Ideal CPU temperature target (°C)                |
| `MIN_SAFE_PWM`           | 65      | Absolute minimum PWM (fans may stall below this) |
| `MAX_SAFE_TEMP_C`        | 95      | Emergency full speed threshold                   |
| `GAIN_TENTHS`            | 20      | Proportional gain × 10                           |
| `RISE_EMA_HUNDREDTHS`    | 25      | Faster response when temperature rising          |
| `FALL_EMA_HUNDREDTHS`    | 8       | Slower response when temperature falling         |
| `HOLD_TIME_AFTER_UP_SECS`| 90      | Minimum seconds to hold PWM after upward change  |
| `SLEEP_SECS`             | 6       | Interval between temperature readings            |

### Installation

1. Copy the script to `/usr/local/sbin/cpu-fan-curve.sh`
2. Make it executable: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/cpu-fan-curve.sh`
3. Create the systemd service:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=CPU fan control curve for Zettlab NAS
After=systemd-modules-load.service multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/cpu-fan-curve.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **Note:** The `After=systemd-modules-load.service` ensures the `zettlab_d8_fans` module is loaded before the fan script starts. Without this, the service will fail because it cannot find the hwmon device.

Save as `/etc/systemd/system/cpu-fan-curve.service`.

4. Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now cpu-fan-curve.service
```

## HDD Fan Control

### Script Location

`/usr/local/sbin/hdd-fan-curve.sh`

### Key Parameters

| Parameter                | Default | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `TARGET_HDD_C`           | 44      | Ideal maximum HDD temperature (°C)               |

| `HOLD_TIME_AFTER_UP_SECS`| 120     | Minimum seconds to hold PWM after upward change  |
| `SLEEP_SECS`             | 20      | Interval between temperature readings            |

The script automatically detects all SATA drives (`/dev/sd[a-h]`) and monitors the maximum temperature.

### Installation

1. Copy the script to `/usr/local/sbin/hdd-fan-curve.sh`
2. Make it executable: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/hdd-fan-curve.sh`
3. Create the systemd service:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HDD fan control curve for Zettlab NAS
After=systemd-modules-load.service multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/hdd-fan-curve.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **Note:** The `After=systemd-modules-load.service` ensures the `zettlab_d8_fans` module is loaded before the fan script starts.

Save as `/etc/systemd/system/hdd-fan-curve.service`.

4. Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hdd-fan-curve.service
```

## Service Management

### Start and Enable Both Services

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now cpu-fan-curve.service hdd-fan-curve.service
```

### Verify Status

```bash
systemctl status cpu-fan-curve.service
systemctl status hdd-fan-curve.service

# View live logs
journalctl -u cpu-fan-curve.service -f
journalctl -u hdd-fan-curve.service -f
```

## Runtime Commands

### Read Current Values

```bash
# Read hwmon device names
for d in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do
    [ -f "$d/name" ] && echo "$d: $(cat "$d/name")"
done

# Read temperature values
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input 2>/dev/null | head -n 5

# Read PWM values
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/pwm[1-3] 2>/dev/null
```

### Manual Override Example

```bash
ZETTLAB=$(for d in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do
    [ -f "$d/name" ] && [[ "$(cat "$d/name")" == "zettlab_d8_fans" ]] && echo "$d"
done)

echo 1 | sudo tee "$ZETTLAB/pwm3_enable"
echo 120 | sudo tee "$ZETTLAB/pwm3"
```

## Expected Behavior

- Fast response on temperature **rise**
- Slow response on temperature **fall** (90s hold for CPU, 120s hold for HDD)
- Very few downward PWM changes after 24–48 hours of mixed load (this is normal and desired)

**Optional fine-tuning**: If your CPU consistently idles 2–3 °C above target, edit `TARGET_CPU_C` in the script.

## Post-Kernel-Upgrade Checklist

After any kernel update, verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. DKMS modules rebuilt?
sudo dkms status | grep zettlab

# 2. Modules loaded?
lsmod | grep -E 'zettlab_d8_fans|zettlab_gpio_keys'

# 3. hwmon device visible?
for d in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do [ -f "$d/name" ] && echo "$(basename $d): $(cat $d/name)"; done | grep zettlab

# 4. Fan services running?
systemctl is-active cpu-fan-curve hdd-fan-curve

# 5. Button service using evdev (not MMIO)?
journalctl -u zettlab-buttons.service --no-pager -n 5 | grep "listening on"

# If any step fails, restart the affected service:
sudo systemctl restart cpu-fan-curve hdd-fan-curve zettlab-buttons
```

If DKMS auto-rebuild failed, manually rebuild:

```bash
# For fans:
sudo dkms build -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-d8-fans -v 0.0.1
sudo modprobe zettlab_d8_fans

# For GPIO keys:
sudo dkms build -m zettlab-gpio-keys -v 1.0
sudo dkms install -m zettlab-gpio-keys -v 1.0
sudo modprobe zettlab_gpio_keys

# Then restart all services:
sudo systemctl restart cpu-fan-curve hdd-fan-curve zettlab-buttons
```

## Power Limits Differ from the Stock Firmware

Measured on the same machine, before and after replacing the vendor OS:

| | Stock firmware | Ubuntu 26.04 |
|---|---|---|
| PL1 `long_term` | 45 W | **200 W** (32 s window) |
| PL2 `short_term` | 93 W | 93 W (2 ms window) |
| PL4 `peak_power` | — | 160 W |
| Chip base power | 28 W | 28 W |

200 W on a 28 W part means no meaningful cap. **PL1 is a firmware/OS setting, not a
hardware lock**, and Ubuntu does not reproduce the vendor's 45 W. Sustained workloads
therefore run hotter and faster than they did on the stock OS.

Read yours with:

```bash
R=/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0
for i in 0 1 2; do
  echo "$(cat $R/constraint_${i}_name): $(( $(cat $R/constraint_${i}_power_limit_uw) / 1000000 )) W"
done
```

### Is the stock cooling enough without the cap?

On a 13-minute Geekbench 6 run: peak 85 °C, average 50 °C, and the decisive number —

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/thermal_throttle/package_throttle_count   # 0
```

Zero throttle events against a Tjmax of 110 °C. The chassis cooling handles an
uncapped PL1 on this part.

### Restoring the vendor cap

Worth doing if you want a quieter machine and care less about sustained throughput:

```bash
echo 45000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_0_power_limit_uw
```

That does not survive a reboot. For a permanent cap, wrap it in a systemd unit ordered
after `multi-user.target`.

> Leave it open if you run LLM inference. The whole point of a long inference run is
> sustained throughput, which is exactly what PL1 governs.

## Safety Notes

- The curves are intentionally conservative and anti-chatter focused
- PWM values below ~60–80 can cause fan stalling
- Thermal lag is significant (30–120+ seconds)
- All scripts include hard-coded minimum safe PWM and emergency full-speed overrides
- If any temperature sensor fails, the system forces full speed (183 PWM)
- Timer-based hysteresis prevents frequent speed adjustments after any upward change
